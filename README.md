# Hey, I'm Quentin!

- I deeply hate the front, that's why I do the back
- I'm redoing social network back for the 18103rd time (PHP, NodeJS, Go, Python? Never)
- My future project office suite AI recreation / interactive AI / Ma√Øa OS (maybe a dating app, yes I get bored when I'm not coding)

For 8 years, I have been passionate about the functioning of computers, but also for their ambition. 
The world is plunged into a precipice of pecuniary will. My ambition is to bring forth strong and tenacious competitors against the greatest!

## My actual project

  ### Social Network

  #### Features 
- [x] üèÅ So what is this language that Google created for us?
- [x] üá´üá∑ Solomon Hykes cocorico
- [x] ‚õëÔ∏è Without him I don't know what I'd do (Redis). Well it's buggy because I can have several WS
- [x] üêò PostgreSQL, at least it doesn't change too much from MySQL
- [x] üêí MongoDB, I'm the only one who would have put a monkey illustration for this tool.
- [ ] üÖ∞Ô∏èüÖøÔ∏è‚ÑπÔ∏è Let's go and create the entire data exchange and query infrastructure - defining an API
- [ ] üßπCleaning is not bad sometimes, my grandmother often says it.
- [ ] üîë Changing the passwords is better because root:example and nubo_user:nubo_password is not great, shit, I gave the passwords, I'm too stupid
- [ ] üçé I like Apple but there... Expo was better
- [ ] ü§ñ I don't like the green robot, but hey at least I actually wanted to say something but I couldn't find what to say, if I don't like it here's something very intelligent
- [ ] ‚ò†Ô∏è Tested I was told one day that it would be good to test before jumping under a bridge
- [ ] üí∞ I was going to forget the money, damn the money, but what did I have in mind? (STRIPE or my own "better" system)
- [ ] üåê Installed all warm and cozy on my server, yes you're cute, you can, you cost me a week's worth of food per month!
- [ ] ü™ë Wait, wait, but not too long, well, there you go, thank you, thank you, go give me your subscription, thank you!
- [ ] üÜôüìÖ Update ... ... I'm lazy, right?
